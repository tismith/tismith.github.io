A little while ago Markus Persson, creator of [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) announced a new game he was proposing.

Part of the game's initial specification was a preliminary description of a hypothetical CPU that could be used and programmed from inside the game, the D-CPU16. I wrote a basic emulater for D-CPU16 binaries based on that description, and it's available on [GitHub][dcpu16]. 

There have since been several new revisions of the D-CPU16 specifications that I've not kept up with, so it's of limited use, but it was a fun project all the same.
