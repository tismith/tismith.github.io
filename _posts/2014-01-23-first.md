I've decided it's a good idea to start writing a coding and technology blog. 

I've been playing with a handful of small interesting projects and placing them on [GitHub][github] over the last few years. I think I'll be better served if I document them more fully, and I think this is the place to so do.

I've built this up at the moment using [GitHub pages][github-pages], along with code and information from:

* [Jekyll][jekyll]
* [Hyde][hyde]
* [PixelCog][pixelcog]

And the site is available as a [GitHub repo]({{ site.github.repo }}).

[github]: {{ site.author.github }}
[github-pages]: http://pages.github.com
[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com 
[hyde]: http://hyde.getpoole.com
[pixelcog]: http://pixelcog.com/blog/2013/jekyll-from-scratch-introduction/
